According to my research, such emails might be the result of **000Webhost Data Breach** which occurred at around **November 2015** ðŸ‘‰ [source](https://www.000webhost.com/000webhost-database-hacked-data-leaked)

## How to use the filter?

- Download the file `mailFilters.xml` from the root directory
- Open [Gmail Settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters)
- Head to **Filters and Blocked Addresses**
- Click on **Import Filters** which is located at around bottom of the page
- Upload the `mailFilters.xml` file and choose all filters.

## Why use the filter?

Since some genuine messages end up in the SPAM folder sometimes, these SPAM messages pollute the folder and make it difficult to find a genuine message.
